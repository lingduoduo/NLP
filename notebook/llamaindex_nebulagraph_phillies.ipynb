However,\\nthere still often exists an accuracy gap between\\nthese methods and full fine-tuning (FT). In this\\nwork, we first introduce a novel weight decom-\\nposition analysis to investigate the inherent dif-\\nferences between FT and LoRA. Aiming to re-\\nsemble the learning capacity of FT from the\\nfindings, we propose Weight- Decomposed L ow-\\nRankAdaptation ( DoRA ). DoRA decomposes\\nthe pre-trained weight into two components, mag-\\nnitude anddirection , for fine-tuning, specifically\\nemploying LoRA for directional updates to effi-\\nciently minimize the number of trainable param-\\neters. By employing DoRA, we enhance both\\nthe learning capacity and training stability of\\nLoRA while avoiding any additional inference\\noverhead. DoRA consistently outperforms LoRA\\non fine-tuning LLaMA, LLaV A, and VL-BART\\non various downstream tasks, such as common-\\nsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and\\nimage/video-text understanding.\\n1. Introduction\\nModels that are pre-trained with extensive general domain\\ndatasets have demonstrated remarkable generalization abil-\\nities, significantly benefiting a wide array of applications,\\nfrom natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Qin et al.,\\n2023; Taori et al., 2023) to multi-modal tasks (Li et al., 2022;\\nLiu et al., 2023a). To tailor these general models for spe-\\ncific downstream tasks, full fine-tuning (FT) is commonly\\nemployed, involving the retraining of all model parameters.\\nNevertheless, as the size of models and datasets expand\\n*Work done during an internship at NVIDIA1NVIDIA\\n2HKUST.

Among these, LoRA (Hu et al., 2022), which\\ndoes not change the model architecture, has become notably\\npopular for its simplicity and efficacy. Nevertheless, there\\nis still a capacity gap between LoRA and FT, which is often\\nattributed to the limited number of trainable parameters\\nwithout further exploration of other underlying causes (Hu\\net al., 2022; Kopiczko et al., 2024).\\nDrawing on Weight Normalization (Salimans & Kingma,\\n2016), which achieves faster convergence via improving the\\nconditioning of the gradient with weight reparameterization,\\nwe introduce a novel weight decomposition analysis that ini-\\ntially reparameterizes model weights into magnitude and di-\\nrectional components, subsequently examining the changes\\nin magnitude and direction introduced by LoRA and FT.\\nOur analysis reveals that LoRA and FT exhibit markedly\\n1arXiv:2402.09353v3  [cs.CL]  5 Mar 2024'"

Not an unqualified one - there are some quibbles - but in all key respects, it grips, it stirs, it delights.\"\\nCavendish praises the \"thrill-a-minute\" stage craft which sees pupils heading to Hogwarts, at the start of the play, change into school uniforms \"in the blink of an eye\" as they head to the infamous Platform 9Â¾ to make their way to school.\\nThe Stage also gives a five-star review, with Mark Shenton describing Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - co-devised by Rowling, with director John Tiffany and playwright Jack Thorne - as a \"truly game-changing production and a thrilling theatrical endeavour\".\\nIt is an \"entirely original\" piece of work, with \"Dickensian sweep and momentum to the storytelling\", writes Shenton, adding: \"It earns its place on the stage, feeling distinct from both the books and the screen adaptations.\\n\"By turns playful and gripping, disturbing and detailed, poignant and powerful, it is superb family entertainment.\"\\nShenton also praises \"the theatrical wizards who\\'ve created this stunningly-realised alternative universe deliver one coup de theatre after another\".\\nIn a nod to the Kings Cross platform number, Ann Treneman gives the play four and three-quarters stars in The Times, saying the \"wizardry on display\" is \"out of this world\".\\nShe says the plot is complex (\"there are mazes that are more straightforward\") but adds: \"It\\'s a raunchless Game of Thrones with heart.

The West End\\'s ornate Palace Theatre, itself a little like Hogwarts, has a hit probably for years.\"\\nVariety describes it as \"spellbinding\", Matt Trueman writing that it is: \"The Show That Lived Up to Expectations â€” and Then Some.\"\\nHe says the relationship between Albus and Scorpius is \"the friendship of two bullied boys bound together, and it\\'s a beautiful, tender thing\", adding: \"The script by Jack Thorne recognizes that rejection breeds resentment, and outsiders stew into outcasts.\\n\"No one\\'s born a villain, nor sees themselves as such, and where the books gave us stock baddies, Cursed Child fleshes them out.\"\\nChris Jones, in the Chicago Tribune, says that \"heretical as this may sound\", the play left him \"quietly lamenting that the movies were ever made\".\\nBen Brantley in the New York Times writes: \"Like the novels that preceded it, The Cursed Child is stuffed with arcana-filled plots that defy diagrams and baldly wrought sentimental life lessons, along with anguished dives into the earnest, tortured solipsism of adolescence.\\n\"By rights, such a combination should try the patience of any grown-up. But like Ms Rowling\\'s books, the play vanquishes resistance.\"\\nThe Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies since 1997 and been adapted into eight films.\\nThe script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is published this weekend.\\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.', start_char_idx=568637, end_char_idx=570783, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.79623539519736), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='8495f422-7b8d-4e5a-a4d2-7ba7ae2edabb', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/linghuang/Git/NLP/notebook/document/documents.txt', 'file_name': 'documents.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 2132434, 'creation_date': '2024-03-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-03-11'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='b217f4ba-c69a-4bb6-97ac-51731e5985de', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/linghuang/Git/NLP/notebook/document/documents.txt', 'file_name': 'documents.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 2132434, 'creation_date': '2024-03-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-03-11'}, hash='6d27bc87aba76367943e65e5e4a8f41e37ab0ebd2d22da2acd19917f373cddb2'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='2c324651-e389-462c-8895-9abc9a76b78b', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/linghuang/Git/NLP/notebook/document/documents.txt', 'file_name': 'documents.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 2132434, 'creation_date': '2024-03-11', 'last_modified_date': '2024-03-11'}, hash='9782bac5f16613040f5c9c6affddf3e2880220c07646a943589dcf02c60f4633'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='6334cf1d-e880-4bbb-9d53-9faf96cf5b13', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='6534e0c354bd88ead6d9508f4092f9ff8890a4f4a3d64682172deb890494d914')}, text='The play, written by Jack Thorne, is set 19 years after the seventh and final book in the series by JK Rowling.\\nIt opens officially at the Palace Theatre, in London\\'s West End, on Saturday.\\nAudiences have been urged to \"keep the secrets\" since the play began previews in early June.\\nPresented in two parts, the play - showing the stars of the wizarding saga as adults in their mid-30s as their own children head off to school - stretches over five hours.\\nDaily Telegraph critic Dominic Cavendish awarded the play five stars, writing: \"British theatre hasn\\'t known anything like it for decades and I haven\\'t seen anything directly comparable in all my reviewing days.\"\\nHe said \"those involved can give themselves a pat on the back\", adding: \"It\\'s a triumph.
