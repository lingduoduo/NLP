This means that Spotify might register shares on a stock exchange and become a publicly listed company without raising new cash. This tactic would save the music service underwriting fees needed for an IPO and avoid diluting the value of existing stakes in the company. It could also help Spotify avoid a surge in first-day trading that often takes place after an IPO. This approach is rare and is usually used by smaller companies that do not expect high levels of trading in their stock.'"
