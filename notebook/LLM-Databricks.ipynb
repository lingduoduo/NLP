He is currently not hosting the show.\\nGiving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with \\\"hundreds\\\" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.\\nUnder questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.\\n\\\"It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that.\\\"\\nHe said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a \\\"full performance\\\" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.\\nMr Caplan asked: \\\"Could those comments become edgy or sexual?\\\"\\nMr Fox replied: \\\"Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top.\\\"\\nReferring to the \\\"horseplay\\\" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, \\\"otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio\\\".\\nAsked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: \\\"I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?\\n\\\"Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed.\\\"\\nHe added: \\\"But I don't think my behaviour has changed. I'm the same guy now, with the same morals, as I was then.\\\"\\nOne former colleague has accused the DJ of squeezing her breasts from behind. Asked about that, he said: \\\"That would be wholly wrong, totally disrespectful, and it's not something I would do.\\\"\\nThe complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her.\\nAddressing that allegation, he said people in his then-workplace often pretended to have been caught in compromising positions - it was a \\\"play-acting high jinks thing\\\", he said.\\nMr Fox told the court he had seen it \\\"many times\\\", but agreed that out of context, the \\\"Benny Hill-style\\\" comedy could have seemed inappropriate.\\nProsecutor John Price QC said: \\\"She says that when you did that to her, she did not consent to it. Are you in a position to dispute that?\\\"\\nMr Fox replied: \\\"I can't get in (her) head.\\\"\\nMr Price continued: \\\"Did you ask her before you did it if it was okay?\\\" to which the defendant replied: \\\"No.\\\"\\nMr Fox also denied having sexual contact with a 15-year-old fan, including during a private tour of Capital Radio's record library.\\n\\\"It never happened,\\\" he said, although he did acknowledge he \\\"could have easily taken her for a tour\\\".\\nMr Fox agreed it would be \\\"quite wrong\\\" for an adult man to \\\"stick his tongue\\\" into the mouth of a teenage girl, as the woman alleged he had done in the station's car park on another occasion.\\nIf a young fan asked him for a kiss, he would respond with \\\"a social kiss\\\" on the cheek, he said.\\nThe girl in question had, he added, \\\"become a little bit obsessed with me\\\".\\nAsked why three unrelated individuals were accusing him of similar inappropriate conduct, Mr Fox replied: \\\"I don't have an explanation at all.\\\"\\nMr Price said: \\\"Coincidence is ridiculous, isn't it, as an explanation for these things?\\\"\\nThe DJ replied: \\\"I can't explain those coincidences.\\\"\\nThe trial continues.\"\n",

She had been raped by the same man.\\nWhen she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.\\nLater, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell.\\nAfterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done.\\nThis bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a \\\"judicial committee\\\" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice.\\nKaren, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process.\\nThe elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses.\\nDespite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice.\\nHe is now serving a 14-year prison sentence.\\nHis punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one.\\nEven when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate.\\nKaren's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved.\\nIn a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases.\\nConfidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.\\nNowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.\\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.\\nIn a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.\\nTheir statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.\\nKaren Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.\\nFor both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.\\nThe organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves \\\"disfellowshipped\\\" or shunned.\\nJehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house.\\nFor many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children.\\nOther churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950.\\nThat inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate.\\nHowever, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing.\\nOnly this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.\\nTodros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.\\nThe case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.\\nThe court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been \\\"ostracised\\\" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.\\nFor young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.\\nSexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.\\nMany religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.\\nThe survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.\\nThe Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:\\nLocal authorities\\nThe police\\nThe Crown Prosecution Service\\nThe Immigration Service\\nThe BBC\\nThe armed forces\\nSchools\\nHospitals\\nChildren's homes\\nChurches, mosques and other religious organisations\\nCharities and voluntary organisations\\nFull details of the inquiry\\nCaroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July.\"\n",

But it's all over the place.\\\"\\nSo why did all these different species acquire the same colour?\\nGiven their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.\\nThat is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.\\n\\\"It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,\\\" Mr Hsiung said. \\\"That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.\\n\\\"But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there.\\\"\\nIt may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.\\n\\\"We don't know yet,\\\" Mr Hsiung said.\\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter\"\n",

Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\\n\\\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\\\"\\nFor four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\\nCotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\\nHe's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\\nHe has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\\nCotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \\\"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\\\" he says.\\nI understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\\n\\\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.\\\"\\nHe tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \\\"scuffles\\\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\\n\\\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\\\" Cotter recounts. \\\"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\\n\\\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight.\\n\\\"It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards.\\\"\\nYears later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important.\\nEight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final.\\nIn 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game.\\nClermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland?\\n\\\"It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,\\\" he explains.\\n\\\"One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog.\\n\\\"Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick.\\n\\\"Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors.\\n\\\"Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche.\\n\\\"Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly.\\\"\\nIn Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nScotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations.\\n\\\"The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,\\\" says Cotter. \\\"It was about creating clarity.\\n\\\"The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting.\\n\\\"You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win.\\n\\\"There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks.\\\"\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nOn the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. \\\"We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,\\\" Cotter recalls.\\n\\\"We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two.\\n\\\"It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him.\\\"\\nBeyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks.\\n\\\"We know that these teams are very good,\\\" he insists. \\\"When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit.\\\"\\nFive more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says.\\nWhen the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby. There had been little hint of it, no suggestion his time was coming to an end.\\nHe would have preferred to stay on, but Gregor Townsend was ready for an elevation and there was only one way that was going to happen.\\nWill he miss it? \\\"Undoubtedly, but we'll come back on holiday,\\\" he says. \\\"You never know, you might find that Glasgow are in Montpellier's pool next year in European rugby.\\n\\\"It was always going to be the deal. The SRU had made it known at the outset that they'd like a Scottish coach in the national position sooner or later and I respect entirely the decision. Would I have liked to continue? Yeah, probably would have, but that's the way it is.\\\"\\nCotter, without doubt, has been good for Scotland but he says Scotland has been good for him, too.\\n\\\"I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here,\\\" he explains. \\\"I recognise it in our rural communities.\\n\\\"I'm not an extroverted person - I'm introverted, I'm quiet - and I love the countryside, I love what Scotland has got to offer, whether it's the coastline, the mountains, the rivers. I enjoyed my time in Colonsay, fishing on the west coast in Plockton, stalking in Glen Shiel.\\n\\\"We've got some good friends in the Borders who love their rugby and it's nice to see their passion. They talk about passion in France, but there's some real passion here for the game.\\n\\\"It's been a privilege, the whole thing. I've only got fond memories. I move on. The game has existed in this country for over a hundred years and it will exist long after I've left. There's another project to move to after I finish here. We were going to go back to New Zealand but then Montpellier came up. They wanted something constructed and the communication I had with the president convinced me that there was perhaps another adventure to take on.\\\"\\nMore than anything he wants to exit on a high. In the coming weeks he says he wants the team to deliver moments that will bond them together not just in the here and now but for decades down the road.\\n\\\"They give everything, these guys,\\\" he adds. \\\"They're striving to give people something to be proud of. The stadium is a sell-out for Ireland. So, game on...\\\"\"\n",

Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.\\nCharacter is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.\\nAt 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.\\nWe had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.\\nThey were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.\\nFor Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.\\nHe always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.\\nHe comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.\\nSo it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.\\nAt times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.\\nThese days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.\\nTim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.\\nVilla have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.\\nBut, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.\\nYou have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.\\nVilla's net spend over the summer was under \\u00a310m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.\\nThey have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.\\nI don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.\\nYou cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.\\nI get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.\\nSherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.\\nThe choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.\\nLike Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.\\nIn an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.\\nBut what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.\\nSherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.\\nWhoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.\\nBecause he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.\\nGrealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.\\nHowever good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.\\nWhen you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.\\nYou really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.\\nThat might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.\\nAfter trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.\\nA settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right.\\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\"\n",

If I have money to go, I will go. I will take advantage of my age and my energy to help you out.'\\\"\\nAbout half of the young people from Gonzaga move abroad in the hope of securing a better future.\\nThe Home Office said Mr Menezes had been granted entry to the UK for six months as a visitor on his arrival on 13 March 2002.\\nHe then applied for leave to remain as a student, which was approved. He was granted leave to remain until 30 June 2003.\\nThe Home Office says his visa expired at that time and that he remained illegally in the UK until his death.\\nLike many Brazilians in London, Mr Menezes would send money home to his parent's modest farm in Gonzaga.\\n\\\"He didn't make a lot of money,\\\" his father said. \\\"Most of his money went on rent and food.\\n\\\"He wanted to stay for another two years to save money so he could come back and invest in a ranch.\\\"\\nHe said his son was happy in London.\\nFriends say Mr Menezes was as shocked as all Londoners by the 7 July 2005 Tube and bus bombings, as well as the attempted London public transport attacks on Thursday 21 July - the day before he was shot.\\nG\\u00e9sio C\\u00e9sar D'avila, a friend and colleague, said Mr Menezes had considered alternative transport after the failed attacks.\\n\\\"We were together on Thursday, and when we saw what happened, Jean said he wanted to buy a motorbike to avoid the Tube,\\\" he said.\\nOn 22 July, the day Mr Menezes was killed, police and soldiers had been watching the block of flats in Tulse Hill, where the electrician lived.\\nThey believed Hussain Osman, one of the failed 21 July bombers, was living there. What they did not immediately realise was that the flats shared a communal entrance.\\nIt is thought Mr Menezes left his flat, which he shared with cousins Vivian and Patricia, in order to fit a fire alarm.\\nUndercover police officers began following Mr Menezes because they thought he looked like Osman.\\nHe took a bus to Stockwell station, where he boarded a train. There he was pinned down and shot seven times in the head and once in the shoulder by two officers trained in stopping suicide bombers.\\nPolice were later to say the officers had feared for their own lives and for those of other passengers on the train.\\nIn the days that followed the shooting, a makeshift memorial to Mr Menezes was set up outside Stockwell Tube station.  The shrine of flowers, candles, pictures and newspaper articles became a gathering point for campaigners seeking answers over the incident.\\nAlmost a year after his death, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that no officers would be prosecuted, but the Met Police would be tried for breaching health and safety laws.\\nOn 1 November 2007, the force was found guilty at the Old Bailey of endangering the public over the operation that led to the shooting and fined \\u00a3175,000 with \\u00a3385,000 costs. A jury found the force broke health and safety laws when officers pursued Mr Menezes and shot him seven times\\nAn inquest into Mr Menezes death began on 22 October 2008. The jury rejected the police account Mr de Menezes was killed lawfully by two officers and returned an open verdict. The coroner had instructed the jury not to return a verdict of unlawful killing, and gave it the choice of two possible verdicts.\\nThe Met Police settled a damages claim with Mr Menezes family in 2009. The amount of compensation the family will receive was not disclosed.\\nIn January 2010, Menezes family members and campaigners gathered at Stockwell station on what would have been his 32nd birthday to unveil a permanent memorial.

Everton offered a stern test and City showed growing maturity to get the three points.\\nEverton's superbly drilled defensive formation offered nothing other than frustration to City in the first half as they stood firm.\\nMoyes had clearly earmarked Silva as central to City's threat and he deployed youngster Jack Rodwell to man-mark the Spaniard. And when he received a yellow card for a foul on Silva responsibility briefly switched to Phil Neville, until he drew similar punishment from referee Webb after a clash with Silva.\\nSergio Aguero was City's main threat in the early exchanges, but it was the 53rd minute before Everton posed a serious threat as Tim Cahill's header from Seamus Coleman's cross floated over the bar.\\nIt was only when Balotelli came on for Edin Dzeko on the hour that City made serious inroads into the Everton defence. Samir Nasri had a shot well saved by Tim Howard before the Italian broke the deadlock seven minutes after his introduction.\\nBalotelli's finish from the edge of the area was measured and also took a decisive touch off Everton defender Phil Jagielka to send the ball tantalisingly out of Howard's reach into the bottom corner.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nThe visitors now needed to shift the entire emphasis of their approach, but City were playing with renewed confidence and Silva hit the woodwork with Howard beaten.\\nBalotelli was then narrowly off target before setting up Silva for a tap-in, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside.\\nSilva was at his creative best as City wrapped up the win with one minute left. Everton substitute Royston Drenthe lost possession in midfield and Silva threaded through a perfect invitation for Milner to slide his finish past Howard.\\nEverton had offered next to nothing in terms of attacking threat, although another City substitute Stefan Savic made a timely intervention in injury time to clear Marouane Fellaini's shot off the line.\\nLive text commentary\"\n",

But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.\\nWhile this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.\\nDr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: \\\"Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.\\\"\\nThe observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.\\nDiscussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: \\\"The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.\\n\\\"It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.\\\"\\nDescribing his diamond sample, he said: \\\"It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.\\\"\\nProf Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.\\nHe said: \\\"I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.\\n\\\"This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy.\\\"\\nA key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.\\nRingwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.\\nGrains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.\\nGiven the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term \\\"blue planet\\\" seems even more appropriate for Earth.\"\n",

So, by any measure that is unacceptable.\\n\\\"That is thousands of patients, the majority of whom are elderly, ready to go back home or into the community but can't because the extra support they need just isn't there.\\\"\\nShe also claimed that delayed discharge got worse during the peak of summer despite Health Secretary Shona Robison saying in February that she wanted to \\\"completely eradicate\\\" the problem.\\nThe substance is this. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: \\\"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target.\\\"\\nA delay of that duration, for the avoidance of doubt, involves a patient being kept in hospital for at least six weeks longer than clinically necessary, generally because no alternative care is available.\\nDr Simpson said he had checked with parliament's own information centre. Based on that research, allied to his own knowledge, he believed the First Minister's remarks were misleading.\\nAccording to Labour, Scotland's patients had not enjoyed \\\"zero delays over six weeks\\\" for three years. That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge.\\nThe immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. The general tenor of her remarks was that matters were improving - while there remained more to be done.\\nDr Simpson has now, in effect, suggested that Ms Sturgeon might reconsider that stance.\\nRead more from Brian\\nMs Sturgeon responded by acknowledging that there was still work to do, but said \\\"real progress\\\" was being made.\\nShe later added: \\\"Since 2007 there's been a 52% reduction in delays over four weeks, a 55% reduction in delays over six weeks, the number of delays over three days is down by 50%, the number of delays over four weeks has been reduced as well.\\n\\\"Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we've progressively toughened that target and we're now focusing on ensuring patients are discharged within 72 hours.\\\"\\nThat comment drew an angry response from Labour MSP Dr Richard Simpson, who subsequently made a formal point of order to the presiding officer.\\nDr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012.\\nHe also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone.\\nDr Simpson added: \\\"We all know that nationalist rhetoric is divorced from reality but this is completely unacceptable.  It was completely wrong to claim that these targets had been met when in reality thousands of patients had waited in hospital beds.\\n\\\"Our NHS is in real trouble. The health minister pledged to abolish delayed discharge by the end of the year. Instead it is going in the wrong direction. Meanwhile we see the first minister is making completely false claims about her government's record.\\n\\\"Patients and staff don't benefit from bogus claims about NHS performance. The first minister should correct the record, and this SNP government should get a grip of delayed discharge rather than bury their heads in the sand.\\\"\\nBut a Scottish government spokeswoman said: \\\"The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government.\\n\\\"Subsequently, the Scottish government introduced new tougher targets that no patient should wait more than four weeks, and later two weeks, from when they are clinically ready for discharge.\\n\\\"Working with our partners in local government we've made the level of performance we expect tougher still, with an ambition for patients to be delayed for no more than 72 hours.\\\"\"\n",

      "   \"Mr Fox, 54, from London, denies eight counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault between 1988 and 2014.\\nHe said there was often \\\"horseplay\\\" with colleagues, involving \\\"piggybacks, tickling and squeezing\\\".\\nBut he told Westminster Magistrates' Court such behaviour was consensual.\\nMr Fox, who uses the nicknames Dr Fox and Foxy, became well known for presenting the chart show on Capital Radio, and was a judge on the ITV show Pop Idol between 2001 and 2003 alongside Simon Cowell.\\nHe joined Magic 105.4 in 2005, where he presents the breakfast show, Foxy in the Morning. He is currently not hosting the show.\\nGiving evidence on Wednesday, Mr Fox said he had worked with \\\"hundreds\\\" of female colleagues during his career, but had never been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour until last year.\\nUnder questioning from his defence counsel, Jonathan Caplan QC, he told the court his teams had kept their energy up during live broadcasts by playing loud music, dancing and creating makeshift obstacle courses.\\n\\\"It sounds daft, but it was the way we, I, got myself going, and the team would join in very much as well. They would be part of that.\\\"\\nHe said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a \\\"full performance\\\" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another.\\nMr Caplan asked: \\\"Could those comments become edgy or sexual?\\\"\\nMr Fox replied: \\\"Of course they could. Like any office. Some of it could be saucy, cheeky, over-the-top.\\\"\\nReferring to the \\\"horseplay\\\" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, \\\"otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio\\\".\\nAsked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: \\\"I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it?\\n\\\"Laws have changed. HR has changed. Political correctness has changed.\\\"\\nHe added: \\\"But I don't think my behaviour has changed. I'm the same guy now, with the same morals, as I was then.\\\"\\nOne former colleague has accused the DJ of squeezing her breasts from behind. Asked about that, he said: \\\"That would be wholly wrong, totally disrespectful, and it's not something I would do.\\\"\\nThe complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her.\\nAddressing that allegation, he said people in his then-workplace often pretended to have been caught in compromising positions - it was a \\\"play-acting high jinks thing\\\", he said.\\nMr Fox told the court he had seen it \\\"many times\\\", but agreed that out of context, the \\\"Benny Hill-style\\\" comedy could have seemed inappropriate.\\nProsecutor John Price QC said: \\\"She says that when you did that to her, she did not consent to it. Are you in a position to dispute that?\\\"\\nMr Fox replied: \\\"I can't get in (her) head.\\\"\\nMr Price continued: \\\"Did you ask her before you did it if it was okay?\\\" to which the defendant replied: \\\"No.\\\"\\nMr Fox also denied having sexual contact with a 15-year-old fan, including during a private tour of Capital Radio's record library.\\n\\\"It never happened,\\\" he said, although he did acknowledge he \\\"could have easily taken her for a tour\\\".\\nMr Fox agreed it would be \\\"quite wrong\\\" for an adult man to \\\"stick his tongue\\\" into the mouth of a teenage girl, as the woman alleged he had done in the station's car park on another occasion.\\nIf a young fan asked him for a kiss, he would respond with \\\"a social kiss\\\" on the cheek, he said.\\nThe girl in question had, he added, \\\"become a little bit obsessed with me\\\".\\nAsked why three unrelated individuals were accusing him of similar inappropriate conduct, Mr Fox replied: \\\"I don't have an explanation at all.\\\"\\nMr Price said: \\\"Coincidence is ridiculous, isn't it, as an explanation for these things?\\\"\\nThe DJ replied: \\\"I can't explain those coincidences.\\\"\\nThe trial continues.\",\n",
      "   \"He would go upstairs, on the premise that he was saying a prayer with his niece, then sexually abuse her.\\nNow in her 30s, Karen wasn't understood when she first told her parents what her uncle, Mark Sewell, was doing.\\nSewell was also the son of a trusted older member of the local Jehovah's Witnesses congregation, known as an elder.\\nChristian churches, as well as other religions, have faced claims of child abuse.\\nBut what is striking about the Jehovah's Witnesses is their explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house.\\nBecause of their practice of following the Bible literally, they insist there must be two witnesses to a crime, often not the case in child abuse cases.\\nHowever, in Karen's case a second witness did come forward: Wendy, a family friend and fellow member of the Barry congregation in south Wales. She had been raped by the same man.\\nWhen she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.\\nLater, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell.\\nAfterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done.\\nThis bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a \\\"judicial committee\\\" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice.\\nKaren, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process.\\nThe elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses.\\nDespite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice.\\nHe is now serving a 14-year prison sentence.\\nHis punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one.\\nEven when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate.\\nKaren's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved.\\nIn a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases.\\nConfidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.\\nNowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.\\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.\\nIn a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.\\nTheir statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.\\nKaren Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.\\nFor both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.\\nThe organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves \\\"disfellowshipped\\\" or shunned.\\nJehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house.\\nFor many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children.\\nOther churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950.\\nThat inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate.\\nHowever, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing.\\nOnly this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.\\nTodros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.\\nThe case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.\\nThe court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been \\\"ostracised\\\" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.\\nFor young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.\\nSexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.\\nMany religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.\\nThe survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.\\nThe Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:\\nLocal authorities\\nThe police\\nThe Crown Prosecution Service\\nThe Immigration Service\\nThe BBC\\nThe armed forces\\nSchools\\nHospitals\\nChildren's homes\\nChurches, mosques and other religious organisations\\nCharities and voluntary organisations\\nFull details of the inquiry\\nCaroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July.\",\n",

      "   \"That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species.\\nThe hue is caused by tiny structures inside the animals' hairs, but those shapes vary across the family tree.\\nThis suggests, the researchers say, that the striking blue is not driven by sexual selection - unlike many other bright colours in the animal kingdom.\\nThis argument is also supported by the fact that tarantulas have poor colour vision, and do not appear to show off their hairy blue body parts during courtship.\\nNonetheless, Bor-Kai Hsiung and his colleagues found that 40 out of 53 groupings (genera) of tarantula exhibit a very vibrant blue.\\n\\\"We collected published data and constructed a super-tree, which combined the previous published small trees,\\\" said Mr Hsiung, a PhD student at the University of Akron in Ohio and the first author of the study, published in Science Advances.\\nThey then mapped blueness onto that evolutionary tree, based on a bank of tarantula snaps scoured from the internet.\\n\\\"If the genus has at least one species that's blue, we say that's a blue genus,\\\" Mr Hsiung explained.\\nGiven that scattering of blue species, he added, they then calculated \\\"the lowest number of changes that can produce a distribution of blue colouring like this\\\".\\nThe answer? \\\"Eight is the lowest number, so it's [evolved] at least eight times.\\\"\\nWhat is more, all these blue spiders evolved almost precisely the same shade; the wavelengths the team saw in the images all fell within a tight 20 nanometre range, clustered around 450nm - a bright, cobalt blue.\\nThe team also purchased specimens of eight tarantula species, and took a close look at those blue hairs.\\nThey used electron microscopes to zoom in on tiny shapes within the hairs and conducted simulations of how those shapes could produce a \\\"structural colour\\\" by reflecting - very specifically - this wavelength of blue light.\\nThe results, again, pointed to the colour cropping up multiple times independently: several different types of shape could be seen, even on the same branch of the family tree.\\n\\\"That's one of the reasons why it must have evolved so many times - because we don't see a very clear pattern of how these different mechanisms split,\\\" Mr Hsiung said.\\n\\\"If we could see a clear split, then it might have evolved just one or two times. But it's all over the place.\\\"\\nSo why did all these different species acquire the same colour?\\nGiven their relatively simple eyes, it is doubtful that tarantulas can distinguish this shade of blue from any other colour.\\nThat is one of the reasons that sexual selection seems unlikely - by contrast with some other spiders, which have remarkably good vision and put on very colourful courtship displays, such as the mesmerising peacock spider.\\n\\\"It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour,\\\" Mr Hsiung said. \\\"That's very strong evidence to suggest that this blue colour has a very important visual signalling function.\\n\\\"But if it's not for other tarantulas, then it must be to some other receivers out there.\\\"\\nIt may be that this colour helps conceal the critters from their prey while they hunt at night; or perhaps it serves as a warning to stop the tarantulas themselves being eaten.\\n\\\"We don't know yet,\\\" Mr Hsiung said.\\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter\",\n",

      "   \"Media playback is not supported on this device\\nIt's 1997 and ID7 television are filming at Dunkirk rugby club in northern France. Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\\n\\\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\\\"\\nFor four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\\nCotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\\nHe's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\\nHe has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\\nCotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \\\"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\\\" he says.\\nI understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\\n\\\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.\\\"\\nHe tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \\\"scuffles\\\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\\n\\\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\\\" Cotter recounts. \\\"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\\n\\\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight.\\n\\\"It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards.\\\"\\nYears later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important.\\nEight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final.\\nIn 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game.\\nClermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland?\\n\\\"It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,\\\" he explains.\\n\\\"One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog.\\n\\\"Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick.\\n\\\"Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors.\\n\\\"Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche.\\n\\\"Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly.\\\"\\nIn Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nScotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations.\\n\\\"The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,\\\" says Cotter. \\\"It was about creating clarity.\\n\\\"The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting.\\n\\\"You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win.\\n\\\"There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks.\\\"\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nOn the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. \\\"We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,\\\" Cotter recalls.\\n\\\"We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two.\\n\\\"It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him.\\\"\\nBeyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks.\\n\\\"We know that these teams are very good,\\\" he insists. \\\"When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit.\\\"\\nFive more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says.\\nWhen the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby. There had been little hint of it, no suggestion his time was coming to an end.\\nHe would have preferred to stay on, but Gregor Townsend was ready for an elevation and there was only one way that was going to happen.\\nWill he miss it? \\\"Undoubtedly, but we'll come back on holiday,\\\" he says. \\\"You never know, you might find that Glasgow are in Montpellier's pool next year in European rugby.\\n\\\"It was always going to be the deal. The SRU had made it known at the outset that they'd like a Scottish coach in the national position sooner or later and I respect entirely the decision. Would I have liked to continue? Yeah, probably would have, but that's the way it is.\\\"\\nCotter, without doubt, has been good for Scotland but he says Scotland has been good for him, too.\\n\\\"I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here,\\\" he explains. \\\"I recognise it in our rural communities.\\n\\\"I'm not an extroverted person - I'm introverted, I'm quiet - and I love the countryside, I love what Scotland has got to offer, whether it's the coastline, the mountains, the rivers. I enjoyed my time in Colonsay, fishing on the west coast in Plockton, stalking in Glen Shiel.\\n\\\"We've got some good friends in the Borders who love their rugby and it's nice to see their passion. They talk about passion in France, but there's some real passion here for the game.\\n\\\"It's been a privilege, the whole thing. I've only got fond memories. I move on. The game has existed in this country for over a hundred years and it will exist long after I've left. There's another project to move to after I finish here. We were going to go back to New Zealand but then Montpellier came up. They wanted something constructed and the communication I had with the president convinced me that there was perhaps another adventure to take on.\\\"\\nMore than anything he wants to exit on a high. In the coming weeks he says he wants the team to deliver moments that will bond them together not just in the here and now but for decades down the road.\\n\\\"They give everything, these guys,\\\" he adds. \\\"They're striving to give people something to be proud of. The stadium is a sell-out for Ireland. So, game on...\\\"\",\n",

      "   \"If he does become the next Premier League manager to lose his job, it would not just be unfair, it would be absolutely ridiculous.\\nI cleaned Tim's boots when I was an apprentice at Norwich in the late 1980s, and he was the captain at Blackburn Rovers when we won the Premier League together in 1995.\\nOf course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material.\\nWhen I was a teenager I looked up to him because I liked the way he went about things and how he dealt with me and other people. Even though he was a young man then too, the other players all thought the same.\\nCharacter is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them.\\nAt 46, he is a relatively young manager now, certainly in terms of experience, but you have to remember he was quite a young captain at Blackburn too - he was 26 when we were champions.\\nWe had some pretty big-hitters in terms of personalities in that dressing room, the likes of Alan Shearer, David Batty, Tim Flowers and Colin Hendry.\\nThey were never afraid to have their say but, if you speak to them, they will all tell you they admired Tim not just for what he brought to the team as a player but also his contribution to the club's success as captain.\\nFor Tim to be skipper ahead of, say, Shearer shows you what the Blackburn boss Kenny Dalglish thought of him too.\\nHe always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game.\\nHe comes across as confident or even cocky in some respects, but in the dressing room it doesn't matter whether you are an introvert or an extrovert as long as what you are saying makes sense. Tim always did.\\nSo it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him.\\nAt times he might say things that players don't like - because he tells the truth. That ruffles a few feathers but I don't mind it, in fact he should be commended for it.\\nThese days I hear a lot of people in football say things with no substance behind them, but Tim certainly is not like that - he can always back his opinions up.\\nTim earned his right to have a proper crack at being Villa boss with the incredible job he did to keep them up after taking charge in February, when they were in desperate trouble with a dreadful scoring record.\\nVilla have been fighting relegation for a few years now under several different managers so this season was never going to be any different.\\nBut, just eight games into the new campaign and at the first sign of adversity, Sherwood already appears to be under massive pressure.\\nYou have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made.\\nVilla's net spend over the summer was under \\u00a310m - and a lot of that went on young players with little or no Premier League experience.\\nThey have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem.\\nI don't know who had the final say on each deal but from what I understand, Villa's head of recruitment Paddy Reilly and sporting director Hendrik Almstadt play a big part in the process.\\nYou cannot blame Tim for the squad not being strong enough if it is not just down to him, but he is the one who is being criticised because Villa have not won since the opening day.\\nI get why the club's owner Randy Lerner might be getting twitchy because of the amount of money at stake if they go down, but the logical thing to do is to give Sherwood more time because he is an intelligent man who has already shown he can improve players - which is exactly what Villa need now.\\nSherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got.\\nThe choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is.\\nLike Benteke, Rudy Gestede has tremendous physical attributes and is as good as there is in the air in the Premier League.\\nIn an effort to make the most of that, Sherwood has tried to get his full-backs forward to get crosses into the box - Jordan Amavi and Alan Hutton or Leandro Bacuna have all done that far more than any of Villa's midfielders.\\nBut what Gestede doesn't have is the ability to link up play, or the pace to get behind defences. In that way, Benteke was much more of an all-round striker.\\nSherwood can leave out Gestede and play Gabriel Agbonlahor or Jordan Ayew if he wants pace, but then he does not have that same physical presence up front, or any aerial threat.\\nWhoever he picks, he is missing something that Benteke provided on his own.\\nBecause he is trying to find that balance between attack and defence, he cannot always play two up front to solve that problem, especially because he is also trying to fit Jack Grealish into his team as an attacking midfielder.\\nGrealish is a young player who has a lot of talent but picking him creates a different issue because winning games is not just down to what happens when you have got the ball.\\nHowever good Grealish is going forward, he does not always put in a shift going back the other way.\\nWhen you lose possession, you need to be compact and tight defensively and Villa have lacked that in the games I have seen, notably in their defeat by Leicester when they were hit on the counter-attack time and time again.\\nYou really need defensive responsibility when you are in Villa's position near the bottom of the table.\\nThat might be one of the reasons why Sherwood has apparently used this international break to try to get Grealish fitter.\\nAfter trying so many formations and line-ups, maybe we will see Sherwood sticking with just one in the next five or six games.\\nA settled system and some continuity is what Villa need at the moment. Tim knows that and, if he is given the chance, I am confident he will get it right.\\nChris Sutton was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\",\n",

Everton offered a stern test and City showed growing maturity to get the three points.\\nEverton's superbly drilled defensive formation offered nothing other than frustration to City in the first half as they stood firm.\\nMoyes had clearly earmarked Silva as central to City's threat and he deployed youngster Jack Rodwell to man-mark the Spaniard. And when he received a yellow card for a foul on Silva responsibility briefly switched to Phil Neville, until he drew similar punishment from referee Webb after a clash with Silva.\\nSergio Aguero was City's main threat in the early exchanges, but it was the 53rd minute before Everton posed a serious threat as Tim Cahill's header from Seamus Coleman's cross floated over the bar.\\nIt was only when Balotelli came on for Edin Dzeko on the hour that City made serious inroads into the Everton defence. Samir Nasri had a shot well saved by Tim Howard before the Italian broke the deadlock seven minutes after his introduction.\\nBalotelli's finish from the edge of the area was measured and also took a decisive touch off Everton defender Phil Jagielka to send the ball tantalisingly out of Howard's reach into the bottom corner.\\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\\nThe visitors now needed to shift the entire emphasis of their approach, but City were playing with renewed confidence and Silva hit the woodwork with Howard beaten.\\nBalotelli was then narrowly off target before setting up Silva for a tap-in, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside.\\nSilva was at his creative best as City wrapped up the win with one minute left. Everton substitute Royston Drenthe lost possession in midfield and Silva threaded through a perfect invitation for Milner to slide his finish past Howard.\\nEverton had offered next to nothing in terms of attacking threat, although another City substitute Stefan Savic made a timely intervention in injury time to clear Marouane Fellaini's shot off the line.\\nLive text commentary\",\n",

But more extraordinarily, the researchers found that the mineral contains about 1% water.\\nWhile this sounds like very little, because ringwoodite makes up almost all of this immense portion of the deep Earth, it adds up to a huge amount of deep water.\\nDr Sally Gibson from the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, commented: \\\"Finding water in such large concentrations is a hugely significant development in our understanding of the ultimate origin of water now present at Earth's surface.\\\"\\nThe observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches.\\nDiscussing his findings, Prof Pearson told BBC News: \\\"The discovery highlights the unique value of natural diamonds in trapping and preserving fragments of the deep Earth.\\n\\\"It's incredible to think that, as you hold this sample in your hand, the residual pressure at the interface between the diamond and the inclusion is 20,000 atmospheres.\\\"\\nDescribing his diamond sample, he said: \\\"It looks like it's been to hell and back, which it has.\\\"\\nProf Joseph Smyth of the University of Colorado has spent many years studying ringwoodite and similar minerals synthesised in his laboratory.\\nHe said: \\\"I think it's stunning! It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. It tells us that hydrogen is an essential ingredient in the Earth and not added late from comets.\\n\\\"This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy.\\\"\\nA key question posed by the observation is to understand the extent to which plate tectonics on Earth leads to oceans of water being recycled deep within our planet, and to predict the likely amounts of water trapped in other rocky planets.\\nRingwoodite is expected to form deep in Mars as well, for example, where it sits against the metallic core.\\nGrains of the same mineral synthesised in Prof Smyth's laboratory shine bright blue under the microscope.\\nGiven the new findings of ringwoodite's water-bearing capabilities, its abundance at depth, and its beautiful hue, the term \\\"blue planet\\\" seems even more appropriate for Earth.\",\n",

That is, there had been patients during that three-year period who had stayed more than six weeks in hospital beyond potential discharge.\\nThe immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past.

      "   \"An operation to pump 3,000 tonnes of water out of the Hoegh Osaka is expected to last until Sunday.\\nBut poor weather conditions has made it unsafe for the salvors to board on Saturday to finalise pumping arrangements.\\nHigh winds of up to 83mph during the night caused the vessel to drag anchor for approximately 100 metres.\\nThe ship had been anchored to help control its movement.\\nSalvage company Svitzer described working conditions on board as \\\"difficult\\\".\\nThe Hoegh Osaka has been secured two miles (3.2km) east of the Bramble Bank sandbank from which it freed itself on Wednesday.\\nWater, described as being \\\"lightly contaminated with oil\\\" is being pumped from the ship's hold, which salvers say will cause the ship's 50-degree list to decrease.\\nThe film of oil on the water is believed to have come from vehicles held within the hold.\\nWith no power from the ship's generators, the water is being discharged using portable pumps during daylight hours.\\nThe Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said there was no evidence of any pollution.\\nDivers are also waiting until conditions improve to complete an inspection of the hull which began yesterday.\\nThe Queen's Harbour Master has introduced an exclusion zone of 984ft (300m) around the vessel, currently held by tugs between Cowes and Lee-on-Solent.\\nSpeaking at a press conference on Thursday, Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: \\\"I've got confidence the salvors can discharge the bulk of the water from sucking underneath the oil and that will leave us with a small quantity of oil on board the vessel.\\\"\\nThe 51,000-tonne vehicle transporter \\\"refloated\\\" itself unexpectedly at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday due to the high tide.\\nIt was towed two miles east of Bramble Bank, where it was grounded on Saturday.\\nAt a news conference on Tuesday, Bram Sperling of Svitzer, said there was some water inside because of a \\\"small opening in the vessel\\\" that had since been closed.\\nA refloat was the preferred option to avoid further damage to the ship from the sandbank.\\nSalvage experts boarded the ship on Monday and began carrying out an assessment to form a rescue plan.\\nThe Singapore-registered transporter set sail for Germany at about 20:20 on Saturday, shortly before being deliberately run aground by the crew after it unexpectedly started to list.\\nThere were 1,400 cars on board, including 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and 65 Minis, as well as 105 JCB machines and 500 tonnes of fuel.\\nTwo crew members out of 25 rescued by RNLI Lifeboats and the Solent Coastguard on Saturday suffered non-life threatening injuries.\\nTwo senior officers and a pilot stayed on board before being taken ashore.\",\n",
      "   \"A State Department spokesman said the election process was flawed and could not be seen as free and fair.\\nHe said the Ortega government had side-lined opposition candidates and limited monitoring of the polls.\\nDaniel Ortega won 72.5% of the vote with 99.8% of the ballots counted.\\nHis closest rival, centre-right candidate Maximino Rodriguez, only received 14.2% of the vote.\\nThe State Department's Mark Toner  said the Ortega government had not invited international election observers, which he said, \\\"further degraded the legitimacy of the election\\\".\\n\\\"We continue to press the Nicaraguan government to uphold democratic practices, including press freedom and respect for universal human rights in Nicaragua,\\\" he added.\\nMr Ortega had been widely expected to win both due to the popularity of his social programmes and because he faced no obvious political challenger.\\nA former left-wing rebel, Mr Ortega has led Nicaragua through a period of economic stability which has made him popular with the country's business sector and foreign investors.\\nSupporters of Mr Ortega took to the streets to celebrate his victory.\\nBut even before the first results were announced, members of the opposition coalition Broad Front for Democracy (FAD) called the elections a \\\"farce\\\".\\nThe FAD, which had urged voters to boycott the election, alleged that more than 70% had abstained from voting.\\nThey were contradicted by the electoral authorities which put voter participation at 65.8%.\\nMr Ortega's running mate was his wife, Rosario Murillo, who now looks set to become vice-president.\\nAnalysts say that Ms Murillo already shares decision-making with Mr Ortega and could become president if her 70-year-old husband were to bow out.\\nNicaragua's economy has grown at double the Latin American average, but the country still needs to attract more foreign investment.\\nA $50bn (\\u00a340bn) plan to build an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua with Chinese investment has gained international attention, but there are serious doubts over whether it will ever be built.\\nThe country has been able to avoid the sky-high murder rates of some of its Central American neighbours but it also faces the ever pervasive threat of drug-trafficking.\"\n",
