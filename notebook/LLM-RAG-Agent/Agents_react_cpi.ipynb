    "# ReActAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Agents are LLM-powered knowledge workers in LlamaIndex that can intelligently perform various tasks over your data, in both a “read” and “write” function. They are capable of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform automated search and retrieval over different types of data - unstructured, semi-structured, and structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calling any external service API in a structured fashion, and processing the response + storing it for later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that sense, agents are a step beyond our query engines in that they can not only “read” from a static source of data, but can dynamically ingest and modify data from a variety of different tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct, short for Reasoning and Acting, was first introduced in the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf).  \n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct Agent, introduced by LlamaIndex, is an agent-based chat mode built on top of a query engine over your data. ReAct Agent is one of LlamaIndex’s main chat engines. For each chat interaction, the agent enters a reasoning and acting loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, decide whether to use the query engine tool and which query engine tool to use to come up with appropriate input.\n",
    "- Query with the query engine tool and observe its output.\n",
    "- Based on the output, decide whether to repeat the process or give a final response.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use ReAct agent to analyze the U.S. government’s financial reports for fiscal years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n",
