Coastal \nsystems mostly extend seaward from the high-water mark, or just \nbeyond, to the edge of the continental shelf and include shores of soft \nsediments, rocky shores and reefs, embayments, estuaries, deltas and \nshelf systems. Oceanic systems comprise waters beyond the shelf edge, \nfrom ~200 m to nearly 11,000 m deep (Stewart and Jamieson, 2019), \nwith an average depth of approximately 3700 m. The epipelagic zone, \nor upper 200 m of the ocean, is illuminated by sufficient sunlight to \nsustain photosynthesis that supports the rich marine food web. Below \nthe epipelagic zone lies the barely lit mesopelagic zone (200\u20131000 m), \nthe perpetually dark bathypelagic zone (depth >1000 m) and the \ndeep seafloor (benthic ecosystems at depths >200 m), which spans \nrocky and sedimentary habitats on seamounts, mid-ocean ridges and \ncanyons, abyssal plains and sedimented margins. Semi-enclosed seas \n(SES) include both coastal and oceanic systems.\nThe ocean sustains life on Earth by providing essential resources \nand modulating planetary flows of energy and materials. Together, \nharvests from the ocean and inland waters provide more than 20% of \ndietary animal protein for more than 3.3\u00a0billion people worldwide and \nlivelihoods for about 60\u00a0million people (FAO, 2020b). The global ocean \nis centrally involved in sequestering anthropogenic atmospheric CO 2 \nand recycling many elements, and it regulates the global climate system by redistributing heat and water (WGI AR6 Chapter\u00a0 9; Fox-Kemper \net\u00a0al., 2021). The ocean also provides a wealth of aesthetic and cultural \nresources (Barbier et\u00a0al., 2011), contains vast biodiversity (Appeltans \net\u00a0al., 2012), supports more animal biomass than on land (Bar-On et\u00a0al., \n2018) and produces at least half the world\u2019s photosynthetic oxygen \n(Field et\u00a0al., 1998). Ecosystem services (Annex II: Glossary) delivered \nby ocean and coastal ecosystems support humanity by protecting \ncoastlines, providing nutrition and economic opportunities (Figure\u00a03.1; \nSelig et\u00a0al., 2019) and providing many intangible benefits. Even though \necosystem services and biodiversity underpin human well-being and \nsupport climate mitigation and adaptation (P\u00f6rtner et\u00a0al., 2021b), there \nare also ethical arguments for preserving biodiversity and ecosystem \nfunctions regardless of the beneficiary (e.g., Taylor et\u00a0al., 2020). This \nchapter assesses the impact of climate change on the full spectrum of \nocean and coastal ecosystems, on their services and on related human \nactivities, and it assesses marine-related opportunities within both \necological and social systems to adapt to climate change.\nPrevious IPCC Assessment Reports (IPCC, 2014b; IPCC, 2014c; IPCC, \n2018; IPCC, 2019b) have expressed growing confidence in the \ndetection of climate-change impacts in the ocean and their attribution \nto anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.

This powerful generic experimental approach has largely been restricted to single \nspecies because it is logistically complex to conduct experiments that straddle multiple trophic levels, and that also include more than \ntwo drivers (see Figure Box\u00a03.1.1b); the need for multiple replicates, drivers and treatment levels greatly increase the work required \n(Parmesan et\u00a0al., 2013; Boyd et\u00a0al., 2018). It is challenging to apply this experimental approach to communities or ecosystems (see Figure \nBox\u00a03.1.1). To date, most research on community or ecosystem response to climate-induced drivers has been in large-volume (>10,000 l) \nmesocosms (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2014), or at natural analogues such as CO 2 seeps, in which only one driver (ocean acidification) is \naltered (see (4) in Figure Box\u00a03.1.1). Only very recently have two drivers been incorporated into climate-change manipulation studies \nexamining responses of primary producers to secondary consumers (see (5) in Figure Box\u00a03.1.1a; Nagelkerken et\u00a0al., 2020). Therefore, \n\u2018natural experiments\u2019 from the geological past (Reddin et\u00a0al., 2020) provide insights into how food webs and their constituents respond to \ncomplex change involving multiple drivers. Contemporary observations are occasionally long enough (>50\u00a0years) to capture community \nresponses to complex climate change. For example, Brun et\u00a0al. (2019) reported a shift in zooplankton community structure in the North \nAtlantic (1960\u20132014), with major biogeochemical ramifications.\nConducting sufficiently long manipulation experiments to study the effect of adaptation on organisms is equally difficult (see Figure \nBox\u00a03.1.1b), with much research restricted to multi-year studies of the microevolution of fast-growing (more than one division per day) \nphytoplankton species responding to single drivers (Lohbeck et\u00a0al., 2012; Schaum et\u00a0al., 2016). In a few experimental evolution studies \n(see (7) in Figure Box\u00a03.1.1a; Brennan et\u00a0al., 2017), multiple drivers have been used, but none have used communities or ecosystems (see \nFigure Box\u00a03.1.1b). Nevertheless, the fossil record provides limited evidence of adaptations to less rapid (relative to present day) climate \nchange (Jackson et\u00a0al., 2018). Despite the need to explore ecological or biogeochemical responses to projected future ocean conditions, \nlogistical challenges require that assessments of climate-change impacts at scales larger than mesocosms use large-scale, long-term in \nsitu observational studies (as documented in Section\u00a03.4).\nClimate-induced drivers fluctuate on time scales ranging from diurnal \nto annual, with potential consequences for organismal responses \n(Figure\u00a03.10), but these fluctuations are commonly not incorporated \nexperimentally. Experiments that simulate natural fluctuations in \ndrivers, especially beyond tidal or diel cycles, can result in more \ndetrimental impacts than those based on quasi-constant conditions \n(Eriander et\u00a0al., 2015; Sunday et\u00a0al., 2019), but can also ameliorate \neffects (Comeau et\u00a0al., 2014; Laubenstein et\u00a0al., 2020; Cabrerizo et\u00a0al., \n2021), confirming that the influence of environmental variability \nrequires evaluation (Dowd et\u00a0al., 2015). Marine heatwaves exacerbate \nthe impacts of rising mean temperatures, with major ecological \nconsequences (very high confidence) (Fr\u00f6licher et\u00a0al., 2018; IPCC, 2018; \nArafeh-Dalmau et\u00a0al., 2020; Laufk\u00f6tter et\u00a0al., 2020). Higher temperature \nvariability decreased phytoplankton growth and calcification in \nEmiliania huxleyi relative to a stable warming regime (Wang et\u00a0 al., \n2019b). Diel fluctuations (i.e., over 24 h) in carbonate chemistry \nsuperimposed on current and future pCO 2 levels influenced diatom \nspecies differently, depending on their habitat (Li et\u00a0 al., 2016). CO 2 \nfluctuations overlaid on changing mean values also altered phenotypic \nevolutionary outcomes of picoeukaryotic algae (Schaum et\u00a0al., 2016). \nIn the bivalve Mytilus edulis, fluctuating pH regimes exerted higher \nmetabolic costs (Mangan et\u00a0 al., 2017), while salinity fluctuations \nmight be more influential than pH fluctuations in other bivalves (Velez \net\u00a0al., 2016). The amplitude of diel and seasonal pH and CO 2 changes \nare projected to increase in the future due to lowered CO 2 seawater \nbuffering capacity (very high confidence) (Section\u00a03.2.3.1; Burger et\u00a0al., \n2020), which can impose additional stress on organisms.\n3.3.3 Responses to Multiple Drivers\nEach organism encounters a unique combination of local and climate-\ninduced drivers, which vary in space and time. The contribution of \nthese drivers to an organism\u2019s overall biological response, and thereby \nalso potential risks for the organism, depends on the intensity and \n\n question: What are the challenges for multiple-driver research in ecology and evolution as discussed in Box 3.1 of the IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 3?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The challenges for multiple-driver research in ecology and evolution, as discussed in the provided context, primarily revolve around the complexity of conducting experiments that involve multiple species, trophic levels, and drivers. The logistical complexity increases significantly with the need for multiple replicates, drivers, and treatment levels.\n\nMost of the research has been limited to single species studies due to these challenges. Extending this experimental approach to communities or ecosystems is difficult, with most research on community or ecosystem response to climate-induced drivers being conducted in large-volume mesocosms or at natural analogues such as CO2 seeps.\n\nIncorporating multiple drivers into climate-change manipulation studies is a recent development. The fossil record and contemporary observations provide some insights into how food webs and their constituents respond to complex change involving multiple drivers, but conducting sufficiently long manipulation experiments to study the effect of adaptation on organisms is equally difficult.\n\nMoreover, experiments often do not incorporate the fluctuations in climate-induced drivers, which can have potential consequences for organismal responses.

But current MPAs do not provide resilience against observed \nwarming and heatwaves in tropical-to-temperate ecosystems (medium \nconfidence) (Bates et\u00a0al., 2019; Bruno et\u00a0al., 2019; Freedman et\u00a0al., 2020; \nGraham et\u00a0al., 2020; Rilov et\u00a0al., 2020). There is robust evidence that \nprocesses around MPA design and implementation strongly influence \nwhether outcomes are beneficial or harmful for adjacent human \ncommunities (McNeill et\u00a0al., 2018; Zupan et\u00a0al., 2018; Ban et\u00a0al., 2019).\nCurrent placement and extent of MPAs will not provide substantial \nprotections against projected climate change past 2050 (high \nconfidence), as the placement of MPAs has been driven more often \nby political expediency (e.g., Leenhardt et\u00a0al., 2013) than by managing \nkey drivers of biodiversity loss (Cockerell et\u00a0al., 2020; Stevenson et\u00a0al., \n2020) or climate-induced drivers (Bruno et\u00a0 al., 2018). Only 3.5% of \nthe area currently protected will provide refuges from both SST \nand deoxygenation by 2050 under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Bruno \net\u00a0al., 2018), and MPAs are more exposed to climate change under \nRCP8.5 than non-MPAs (Section\u00a03.4.3.3.4; Figure\u00a03.20d). Community \nthermal tolerances will be exceeded by 2050 in the tropics and by \n2150 for many higher-latitude MPAs (Bruno et\u00a0al., 2018). Most MPA \ndesign has focused on the surface ocean, but MPAs are assumed to \nprotect the entire water column and benthos. Climate-induced drivers \n(Section\u00a0 3.2) throughout the water column and rapidly accelerating \nclimate velocities at depths below 200 m (Johnson et\u00a0al., 2018; Brito-\nMorales et\u00a0al., 2020) are projected to affect virtually all North Atlantic \ndeep-water and open-ocean area-based management zones in the \nnext 20\u201350\u00a0years (Johnson et\u00a0al., 2018), and the conservation goals of \nbenthic MPAs in the North Sea are not expected to be fulfilled (Weinert \net\u00a0al., 2021). Heightened risk of non-indigenous species immigration \nfrom vessel traffic plus climate change further endangers MPA success \n(Iacarella et\u00a0 al., 2020), a particular concern in the Mediterranean \n(D\u2019Amen and Azzurro, 2020; Mannino and Balistreri, 2021), where \nthe current MPA network is already highly vulnerable to climate \nchange (Kyprioti et\u00a0 al., 2021). This new evidence supports SROCC\u2019s \nhigh confidence assessment that present governance arrangements, \nincluding MPAs, are too fragmented to provide integrated responses \nto the increasing and cascading risks from climate change in the ocean \n(SROCC SPMC1.2; IPCC, 2019c).\nStrategic conservation planning can yield future MPA networks \nsubstantially more ready for climate change (e.g., Section\u00a0 3.6.3.1.5; \nSROCC SPM C2.1; IPCC, 2019c; Fraz\u00e3o Santos et\u00a0al., 2020; Rassweiler \net\u00a0 al., 2020). \n\n question: What is the expected effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) against climate impacts past 2050, according to the provided context?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The effectiveness of current Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in providing substantial protection against projected climate change impacts past 2050 is expected to be limited. This is primarily due to the fact that the placement and extent of MPAs have often been driven by political expediency rather than managing key drivers of biodiversity loss or climate-induced drivers. Only a small fraction, about 3.5%, of the area currently protected is projected to provide refuges from both sea surface temperature increases and deoxygenation by 2050 under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Furthermore, community thermal tolerances are expected to be exceeded by 2050 in the tropics and by 2150 for many higher-latitude MPAs. Climate-induced drivers throughout the water column and rapidly accelerating climate velocities at depths below 200 m are projected to affect virtually all North Atlantic deep-water and open-ocean area-based management zones in the next 20-50 years. This suggests that the current MPA design and implementation may not be sufficient to address the increasing and cascading risks from climate change in the ocean past 2050."}]}

Coastal \nsystems mostly extend seaward from the high-water mark, or just \nbeyond, to the edge of the continental shelf and include shores of soft \nsediments, rocky shores and reefs, embayments, estuaries, deltas and \nshelf systems. Oceanic systems comprise waters beyond the shelf edge, \nfrom ~200 m to nearly 11,000 m deep (Stewart and Jamieson, 2019), \nwith an average depth of approximately 3700 m. The epipelagic zone, \nor upper 200 m of the ocean, is illuminated by sufficient sunlight to \nsustain photosynthesis that supports the rich marine food web. Below \nthe epipelagic zone lies the barely lit mesopelagic zone (200\u20131000 m), \nthe perpetually dark bathypelagic zone (depth >1000 m) and the \ndeep seafloor (benthic ecosystems at depths >200 m), which spans \nrocky and sedimentary habitats on seamounts, mid-ocean ridges and \ncanyons, abyssal plains and sedimented margins. Semi-enclosed seas \n(SES) include both coastal and oceanic systems.\nThe ocean sustains life on Earth by providing essential resources \nand modulating planetary flows of energy and materials. Together, \nharvests from the ocean and inland waters provide more than 20% of \ndietary animal protein for more than 3.3\u00a0billion people worldwide and \nlivelihoods for about 60\u00a0million people (FAO, 2020b). The global ocean \nis centrally involved in sequestering anthropogenic atmospheric CO 2 \nand recycling many elements, and it regulates the global climate system by redistributing heat and water (WGI AR6 Chapter\u00a0 9; Fox-Kemper \net\u00a0al., 2021). The ocean also provides a wealth of aesthetic and cultural \nresources (Barbier et\u00a0al., 2011), contains vast biodiversity (Appeltans \net\u00a0al., 2012), supports more animal biomass than on land (Bar-On et\u00a0al., \n2018) and produces at least half the world\u2019s photosynthetic oxygen \n(Field et\u00a0al., 1998). Ecosystem services (Annex II: Glossary) delivered \nby ocean and coastal ecosystems support humanity by protecting \ncoastlines, providing nutrition and economic opportunities (Figure\u00a03.1; \nSelig et\u00a0al., 2019) and providing many intangible benefits. Even though \necosystem services and biodiversity underpin human well-being and \nsupport climate mitigation and adaptation (P\u00f6rtner et\u00a0al., 2021b), there \nare also ethical arguments for preserving biodiversity and ecosystem \nfunctions regardless of the beneficiary (e.g., Taylor et\u00a0al., 2020). This \nchapter assesses the impact of climate change on the full spectrum of \nocean and coastal ecosystems, on their services and on related human \nactivities, and it assesses marine-related opportunities within both \necological and social systems to adapt to climate change.\nPrevious IPCC Assessment Reports (IPCC, 2014b; IPCC, 2014c; IPCC, \n2018; IPCC, 2019b) have expressed growing confidence in the \ndetection of climate-change impacts in the ocean and their attribution \nto anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.

We refer to these as multiple lines of evidence, meaning that the evidence comes \nfrom diverse approaches, as described below.\nEmissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from human activity cause ocean warming, acidification, oxygen \nloss, and other physical and chemical changes that are affecting marine ecosystems around the world. At the same \ntime, natural climate variability and direct human impacts, such as overfishing and pollution, also affect marine \necosystems locally, regionally and globally. These climate and non-climate impact drivers counteract each other, add \nup or multiply to produce smaller or larger changes than expected from individual drivers. Attribution of changes in \nmarine ecosystems requires evaluating the often-interacting roles of natural climate variability, non-climate drivers, \nand human-induced climate change. To do this work, scientists use\n\u2022 paleorecords: reconstructing the links between climate and evolutionary and ecological changes of the past;\n\u2022 contemporary observations: assessing current climate and ecological responses;\n\u2022 manipulation experiments: measuring responses of organisms and ecosystems to different climate conditions; and\n\u2022 models: testing whether we understand how organisms and ecosystems are impacted by different stressors, and \nquantifying the relative importance of different stressors.\nPaleorecords can be used to trace the correlation between past changes in climate and marine life. Paleoclimate is \nreconstructed from the chemical composition of shells and teeth or from sediments and ice cores. Changes to sea \nlife signalled by changing biodiversity, extinction or distributional shifts are reconstructed from fossils. Using large \ndatasets, we can infer the effects of climate change on sea life over relatively long time scales\u23af usually hundreds to \nmillions of years. The advantage of paleorecords is that they provide insights into how climate change affects life \nfrom organisms to ecosystems, without the complicating influence of direct human impacts. A key drawback is that \nthe paleo and modern worlds do not have fully comparable paleoclimate regimes, dominant marine species and \nrates of climate change. Nevertheless, the paleorecord can be used to derive fundamental rules by which organisms, \necosystems, environments and regions are typically most affected by climate change. For example, the paleorecord \nshows that coral reefs repeatedly underwent declines during past warming events, supporting the inference that \ncorals may not be able to adapt to current climate warming.\nContemporary observations over recent decades allow scientists to relate the status of marine species and \necosystems to changes in climate or other factors. For example, scientists compile large datasets to determine \nwhether species usually associated with warm water are appearing in traditionally cool-water areas that are rapidly \nwarming. A similar pattern observed in multiple regions and over several decades (i.e., longer than time scales \nof natural variability) provides confidence that climate change is altering community structure. This evidence is \nweighed against findings from other approaches, such as manipulation experiments, to provide a robust picture of \nclimate-change impacts in the modern ocean.\nIn manipulation experiments, scientists expose organisms or communities of organisms to multiple stressors, for \nexample, elevated CO 2, high temperature, or both, based on values drawn from future climate projections. Such \nexperiments will involve multiple treatments (e.g., in different aquarium tanks) in which organisms are exposed \nto different combinations of the stressors.

In highly fluctuating \nenvironments (e.g., upwelling regions, coastal zones), multiple drivers \ncan change and interact across temporal and spatial scales, generating \ngeographic mosaics of tolerances and sensitivities to environmental \nand climate change in marine organisms (medium confidence) (Pespeni \net\u00a0al., 2013; Boyd et\u00a0al., 2016; Vargas et\u00a0al., 2017; Li et\u00a0al., 2018a). A \nfurther challenge for marine life lies in its ability to cope with extreme events such as MHWs (Cross-Chapter Box\u00a0 EXTREMES in Chapter\u00a0 2). \nThe interplay between the abruptness, intensity, duration, magnitude \nand reoccurrence of extreme events may alter or prevent evolutionary \nresponses (e.g., adaptation) to climate change and the potential for \nacclimation to extreme conditions such as MHWs (Cheung and Fr\u00f6licher, \n2020; Coleman et\u00a0al., 2020a; Gurgel et\u00a0al., 2020; Gruber et\u00a0al., 2021).\nSome studies have documented higher phenotypic plasticity and \ntolerance to ocean warming and acidification in marine invertebrates \n(Dam, 2013; Kelly et\u00a0 al., 2013; Pespeni et\u00a0 al., 2013; Gait\u00e1n-Espitia \net\u00a0al., 2017a; Vargas et\u00a0al., 2017; Li et\u00a0al., 2018a), seaweeds (Noisette \net\u00a0 al., 2013; Padilla-Gami\u00f1o et\u00a0 al., 2016; Machado Monteiro et\u00a0 al., \n2019) and fish (medium confidence) (Sandoval-Castillo et\u00a0 al., 2020; \nEnbody et\u00a0 al., 2021) living in coastal zones characterised by strong \ntemporal fluctuations in temperature, pH, pCO 2, light and nutrients. \nFor these populations, strong directional selection with intense and \nhighly fluctuating conditions may have favoured local adaptation \nand increased tolerance to environmental stress (low confidence, low \nevidence) (Hong and Shurin, 2015; Gait\u00e1n-Espitia et\u00a0al., 2017b; Li et\u00a0al., \n2018a).\nOther mechanisms acting within and across generations can influence \nselection and inter-population tolerances to environmental and \nclimate-induced drivers. For instance, transgenerational effects and/or \ndevelopmental acclimation, both \u2018carry-over effects\u2019 (where the early-\nlife environment affects the expression of traits in later life stages or \ngenerations), can influence within- and cross-generational changes \nin the tolerances of marine organisms (medium confidence) to ocean \nwarming (Balogh and Byrne, 2020) and acidification (Parker et\u00a0al., 2012). \nOver longer time scales, increasing tolerance to these drivers may be \nmediated by mechanisms such as transgenerational plasticity (Murray \net\u00a0al., 2014), leading to locally adapted genotypes as seen in bivalves \n(Thomsen et\u00a0al., 2017), annelids (Rodr\u00edguez-Romero et\u00a0al., 2016; Thibault \net\u00a0al., 2020), corals (Putnam et\u00a0al., 2020) and coralline algae (Cornwall \net\u00a0 al., 2020). However, transgenerational plasticity is species specific \n(Byrne et\u00a0al., 2020; Thibault et\u00a0al., 2020) and, depending on the rate and \nmagnitude of environmental change, it may either be insufficient for \nevolutionary rescue (Morgan et\u00a0al., 2020) or could induce maladaptive \nresponses (i.e., reduced fitness) in marine organisms exposed to multiple \ndrivers (medium confidence, low evidence) (Figure\u00a0 3.11; Griffith and \nGobler, 2017; Parker et\u00a0al., 2017; Byrne et\u00a0al., 2020).\nAcclimation to environmental pressures and climate change via \nphenotypic plasticity (Section\u00a0 3.3.3; Collins et\u00a0 al., 2020) enables \nspecies to undergo niche shifts such that their present-day climatic \nniche is altered to incorporate new or shifted conditions (Fox et\u00a0al., \n2019).\nMaladaptation can be avoided through a focus on \nbuilding adaptive capacity, community-based management, drivers of \nvulnerability and site-specific measures (low confidence) (Magnan and \nDuvat, 2018; Piggott-McKellar et\u00a0al., 2020; Schipper, 2020).

Ultimately, it threatens the existence of cities and settlements in low-lying areas, and some island nations and their cultural \nheritage (Chapters\u00a09\u201315; Cross-Chapter\u00a0Papers 2, 4; Oppenheimer et\u00a0al., 2019). The challenge can be addressed by mitigation of climate \nchange and coastal adaptation.\nCurrent impacts of sea level rise\nThe rate of global mean SLR was 1.35 mm\u00a0yr\u20131 (0.78\u20131.92 mm\u00a0yr\u20131, very likely range) during 1901\u20131990, faster than during any century \nin at least 3000\u00a0years (high confidence) (WGI AR6 Chapter\u00a09; Stanley and Warne, 1994; Woodroffe et\u00a0al., 2016; Fox-Kemper et\u00a0al., 2021). \nGlobal mean SLR has accelerated to 3.25 mm\u00a0yr\u20131 (2.88\u20133.61 mm\u00a0yr\u20131, very likely range) during 1993\u20132018 (high confidence). Extreme \nsea levels have increased consistently across most regions (WGI AR6 Chapter\u00a09; Fox-Kemper et\u00a0al., 2021). The largest observed changes \nin coastal ecosystems are being caused by the concurrence of human activities, waves, current-induced sediment transport and extreme \nstorm events (medium confidence) (Chapters\u00a03, 15, 16; Takayabu et\u00a0al., 2015; Mentaschi et\u00a0al., 2018; Duvat, 2019; Murray et\u00a0al., 2019; \nOppenheimer et\u00a0al., 2019). Early impacts of accelerating SLR detected at sheltered or subsiding coasts include chronic flooding at high tides, \nwetland salinisation and ecosystem transitions, increased erosion and coastal flood damage (Chapters\u00a03, 11, 13\u201316; WGI AR6 Chapter\u00a09; \nSweet and Park, 2014; Moftakhari et\u00a0al., 2015; Nunn et\u00a0al., 2017; Oppenheimer et\u00a0al., 2019; Sharples et\u00a0al., 2020; Fox-Kemper et\u00a0al., 2021; \nStrauss et\u00a0al., 2021). The exposure of many coastal populations and ecosystems to SLR is high: economic development is disproportionately \nconcentrated in and around coastal cities and settlements (virtually certain) (Chapters\u00a03, 9\u201315; Cross-Chapter\u00a0Papers 2, 4).\nProjected risks to coastal communities, infrastructure and ecosystems\nRisks from SLR are very likely to increase by one order of magnitude well before 2100 without adaptation and mitigation action as \nagreed by parties to the Paris Agreement (very high confidence). \n\n question: What are the primary factors causing regional rates of relative sea level (RSL) rise to differ from the global mean, as mentioned in the context?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The primary factors causing regional rates of relative sea level (RSL) rise to differ from the global mean, as mentioned in the context, include local subsidence driven by anthropogenic activities such as groundwater and hydrocarbon extraction.

Hypoxia \ncan lead to expanding OMZs, which will favour specialised microbes \nand hypoxia-tolerant organisms (medium confidence) (Breitburg \net\u00a0 al., 2018; Ram\u00edrez-Flandes et\u00a0 al., 2019). As respiration consumes \noxygen and produces CO 2, lowered oxygen levels are often interlinked \nwith acidification in coastal and tropical habitats (Rosa et\u00a0al., 2013; \nGobler and Baumann, 2016; Feely et\u00a0al., 2018) and is an example of a \ncompound hazard (Sections\u00a03.2.4.1, 3.4.2.4).Increased density stratification and mixed-layer shallowing, caused by \nwarming, freshening and sea ice decline, can alter light climate and \nnutrient availability within the surface mixed layer (high confidence) \n(Section\u00a0 3.2.2.3). As light and nutrient levels drive photosynthesis, \nchanges in these drivers directly affect primary producers, often in \ndifferent directions (Matsumoto et\u00a0al., 2014; Deppeler and Davidson, \n2017). Decreased upward nutrient supply is expected to decrease \nprimary production in the low-latitude ocean (medium confidence) \n(Section\u00a0 3.4.4.2.1; Moore et\u00a0 al., 2018a; Kwiatkowski et\u00a0 al., 2019). \nAlternatively, higher mean underwater light levels resulting from \nchanges in sea ice and/or mixed layer shallowing can increase primary \nproduction in high-latitude offshore regions, provided nutrient levels \nremain sufficiently high (medium confidence) (Section\u00a03.4.4.2.1; Cross-\nChapter Paper\u00a06; Vancoppenolle et\u00a0al., 2013; Deppeler and Davidson, \n2017; Tedesco et\u00a0al., 2019; Ardyna and Arrigo, 2020; Lannuzel et\u00a0al., \n2020). In some parts of the open Southern Ocean, where iron limitation \nlargely controls primary productivity (Tagliabue et\u00a0al., 2017), changes \nin wind fields will deepen the summer mixed-layer depth (Panassa \net\u00a0al., 2018), entrain more nutrients, and raise primary productivity in \nthe future (medium confidence) (Cross-Chapter Paper\u00a06; Hauck et\u00a0al., \n2015; Leung et\u00a0al., 2015; Moore et\u00a0al., 2018a; Kwiatkowski et\u00a0al., 2020).\nClimate-induced drivers fluctuate on time scales ranging from diurnal \nto annual, with potential consequences for organismal responses \n(Figure\u00a03.10), but these fluctuations are commonly not incorporated \nexperimentally. Experiments that simulate natural fluctuations in \ndrivers, especially beyond tidal or diel cycles, can result in more \ndetrimental impacts than those based on quasi-constant conditions \n(Eriander et\u00a0al., 2015; Sunday et\u00a0al., 2019), but can also ameliorate \neffects (Comeau et\u00a0al., 2014; Laubenstein et\u00a0al., 2020; Cabrerizo et\u00a0al., \n2021), confirming that the influence of environmental variability \nrequires evaluation (Dowd et\u00a0al., 2015). \n\n question: What is the global mean decrease in oxygen concentration in the upper 1000 meters of the ocean over the period 1970-2010, as reported in the IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 03?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The global mean decrease in oxygen concentration in the upper 1000 meters of the ocean over the period 1970-2010 is reported to be between 0.5-3.3% (very likely range)."}]}

Literature since SROCC supports this assessment (Morato et\u00a0al., 2020; Puerta \net\u00a0al., 2020), although scleractinians and gorgonians are found in regions undersaturated with respect to aragonite (Thresher et\u00a0al., 2011; \nFillinger and Richter, 2013; Baco et\u00a0al., 2017). Laboratory experiments on reef-forming scleractinians show variable results, with regional \nacclimation potential and population-genetic adaptations (Georgian et\u00a0al., 2016; Kurman et\u00a0al., 2017). Desmophyllum pertusum7and \nMadrepora oculata maintain calcification in moderately low pH (7.75) and near-saturation of aragonite (Hennige et\u00a0al., 2014; Maier et\u00a0al., \n2016; B\u00fcscher et\u00a0al., 2017), but lower pH (7.6) and corrosive conditions lead to net dissolution of D. pertusum skeletons (high confidence) \n(Lunden et\u00a0al., 2014; Kurman et\u00a0al., 2017; G\u00f3mez et\u00a0al., 2018). Experiments suggest that D. dianthus is more sensitive to warming than \nacidification and when both are high, as projected under climate change. Warming appears to compensate for declines in calcification, \nwith fitness also sensitive to food availability (Bramanti et\u00a0al., 2013; Movilla et\u00a0al., 2014; Gori et\u00a0al., 2016; Baussant et\u00a0al., 2017; B\u00fcscher \net\u00a0al., 2017; Sch\u00f6nberg et\u00a0al., 2017; H\u00f6fer et\u00a0al., 2018; Maier et\u00a0al., 2019).\nIn OMZ regions (Section\u00a03.2.3.2), benthic species distributions (Sperling et\u00a0al., 2016; Levin, 2018; Gallo et\u00a0al., 2020), abundance and \ncomposition of demersal fishes in canyons (De Leo et\u00a0al., 2012) and deep-pelagic zooplankton (Wishner et\u00a0al., 2018) follow oxygen \ngradients, indicating that deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystem structure will be impacted by extension of hypoxic areas (medium \nconfidence). Fossil records show benthic population collapse and turnover when oxygen ranged from oxic to mildly or severely hypoxic \n(Cross-Chapter\u00a0Box\u00a0PALEO in Chapter\u00a01; Moffitt et\u00a0al., 2015). Regional extirpations among cold-water corals in the paleorecord were \nassociated with substantial declines in oxygen, coincident with abrupt warming and altered properties of intermediate water-masses \n(Wienberg et\u00a0al., 2018; Hebbeln et\u00a0al., 2019). Despite mortality and functional impacts from low oxygen concentrations observed in \naquaria (Lunden et\u00a0al., 2014), recent observations of the deep-water coral D. pertusum suggest adaptive capacity to hypoxia among \nspecimens from OMZ regions that are highly productive (low confidence) (Hanz et\u00a0al., 2019; Hebbeln et\u00a0al., 2020).\nChemosynthetic ecosystems could be particularly prone to oxygen decline (low to medium confidence). Projected OMZ expansion in the \nvicinity of seep communities could favour sulphide-tolerant species, as suggested from fossil records (Moffitt et\u00a0al., 2015), but this will \nexclude large symbiont-bearing foundation species of methane-seep ecosystems (Fischer et\u00a0al., 2012; Sweetman et\u00a0al., 2017). Projected \nwarming, or shifts in warm-current circulation along continental margins, could enhance dissociation of buried methane hydrates (Phrampus \nand Hornbach, 2012; Phrampus et\u00a0al., 2014), either increasing anaerobic methane oxidation (Boetius and Wenzh\u00f6fer, 2013), which benefits \nseep communities, or increasing gas fluxes, which would decrease anaerobic methane oxidation rates and exclude chemosynthetic fauna. \n7 Previously named Lophelia pertusa \n\n question: What are the expected changes in climate-induced drivers in the deep-sea compared to the surface ocean and shallow-water habitats, and how do mitigation strategies impact these changes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The projected changes in climate-induced drivers are expected to be less severe in the deep-sea, which includes the mesopelagic and bathypelagic domains, compared to the surface ocean and shallow-water habitats such as kelp ecosystems and warm-water corals.
