This approach enhances role communication efficiency and allows agents to obtain directional information from other roles and public information from the environment. Additionally, MetaGPT implements a publish-subscribe mechanism that enables agents to exchange information effectively within the multi-agent system. The shared message pool allows all agents to exchange messages directly, publishing structured messages and accessing messages from other entities transparently. This eliminates the need for one-to-one communication and enhances communication efficiency. The subscription mechanism enables agents to select and follow information based on their role profiles, ensuring they receive only task-related information and avoid distractions from irrelevant details.\n"
