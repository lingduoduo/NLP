However, this primarily cash- based discussion of the government\u2019s net \noutlays (deficit) or net receipts (surplus) tells only part of the story. The government\u2019s accrual -based net position, \n(the difference between its assets and liabilities, adjusted for unmatched transactions and balances), and its \n\u201cbottom line\u201d net operating cost (the difference between its revenues and costs) are also key financial indicators. \nThe following includes brief discussions of some of  the diminishing effects of the pandemic on the government\u2019s \nfinancial results for FY 2023. Please refer to Note 29 \u2014COVID- 19 Activity and other disclosures in this Financial \nReport , as well as in the individual entities\u2019 financial statements for more infor mation.  \nComparing the Budget and the Financial Report  \nThe Budget  and the Financial Report  present complementary perspectives on the government\u2019s financial \nposition and condition.  \n\u2022 The Budget  is the government\u2019s primary financial planning and control tool. It accounts for past \ngovernment receipts and spending and includes the President\u2019s proposed receipts and spending plan. \nReceipts are cash received by the U.S. government and spending is measured as  outlays , or payments \nmade by the federal government to the public or entities outside the government. When total receipts \nexceed  outlays, there is a budget surplus ; conversely, if  total outlays exceed total receipts, there is a \nbudget deficit . \n\u2022 The Financial Report  includes the government\u2019s costs and revenues, assets and liabilities, and other \nimportant financial information. It compares the government\u2019s revenues  (amounts earned, but not \nnecessarily collected), with costs (amounts incurred, but not necessarily paid) to derive net operating cost.  \nChart 1 compares the government\u2019s budget deficit (receipts vs. outlays) and net operating cost (revenues vs. \ncosts) for FYs 2019 -  2023.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2157, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53e3e8f3-6a05-4fc4-bccb-df0a307d51e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "53e3e8f3-6a05-4fc4-bccb-df0a307d51e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_path": "reports/executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 904959, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "35e75237-b8c3-42e9-b550-8009930e9a5d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_path": "reports/executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 904959, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-15"}, "hash": "9a74540d1670fba9501e6ad840b2c91e4e266f6bc2704ce87bb1a625930343ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "55013124-096f-4e88-a3c6-86b46eeaa68b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_path": "reports/executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 904959, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-15"}, "hash": "3c691046464825f0f2952ec16c7dee67f2033d079959b8dc30b873c985d34666", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Receipts are cash received by the U.S. government and spending is measured as  outlays , or payments \nmade by the federal government to the public or entities outside the government.

GDP measures the size of the nation\u2019s economy in terms of the total value of all final goods \nand services that are produced in a year.

That estimated fiscal gap for 2023 is 4.5 percent of GDP \n(com pared to 4.9 percent for 2022).  \n\u2022 This estimate implies that making fiscal policy sustainable over the next 75 years would require some \ncombination of spending reductions and receipt increases that equals 4.5 percent of GDP on average over \nthe next 75 years . The fiscal gap represents 23.8 percent of 75- year PV receipts and 19.8 percent of 75-\nyear PV non- interest spending . \n\u2022 The timing of policy changes to make fiscal policy sustainable has important implications for the well -\nbeing of future generations as is s hown in Table 2.  \n \no Table 2 shows that, if reform begins in 2034 or 204 4, the estimated magnitude of primary surplus \nincreases necessary to close the 75 -year fiscal gap is 5. 3 percent  and 6.5 percent of GDP, respectively. \nThe difference between the primary surplus increase necessary if reform begins in 203 4 or 2044 and \nthe increase necessary if reform begins in 202 4, an additional 0.8 and 2.0 percentage points, \nrespectively, is a measure of th e additional burden policy delay would impose on future generations.  \no The longer policy action to close the fiscal gap  is delayed, the larger the post -reform primary surpluses \nmust be to achieve the target debt -to-GDP ratio at the end of the 75- year period. Future generations are \nharmed by a policy delay because the higher the primary surpluses are during their lifetimes, the \ngreater is the difference between the taxes they pay and the programmatic spending from which they \nbenefit.  \nConclusion  \n\u2022 Projections in the Financial Report  indicate that the government \u2019s debt -to-GDP ratio is projected to rise \nover the 75- year projection period and beyond if current policy is kept in place.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2052, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "068d5b59-b1e8-4040-a4d6-7980f3274c0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "068d5b59-b1e8-4040-a4d6-7980f3274c0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_path": "reports/executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 904959, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13716c42-93ae-4f46-b223-da1b6f80e707", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_path": "reports/executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 904959, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-15"}, "hash": "62cb25c805a1e7aff2a959a85b6501afe06c66b3c5aea088f3c09c81c383292e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a808304-9cce-4bac-9329-6c9a47fdf3ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_path": "reports/executive_summary_2023.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 904959, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2024-02-15"}, "hash": "1e6c1e9f9d72a4785519303b5bfc04ecf73f7d04d642edf3bdf86359794bf687", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "o The longer policy action to close the fiscal gap  is delayed, the larger the post -reform primary surpluses \nmust be to achieve the target debt -to-GDP ratio at the end of the 75- year period.
