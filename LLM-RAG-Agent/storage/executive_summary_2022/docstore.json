That estimated fiscal gap for 2022 is 4.9 percent of GDP \n(compared to 6.2 percent for 2021).  \n\u2022 This estimate implies that making fiscal policy sustainable over the next 75 years would require some \ncombination of spending reductions and receipt increases that equals 4.2 perc ent o f GDP on average over \nthe next 75 years. The fiscal gap represents 26.0 percent of 75- year PV receipts and 21.2 percent of 75-\nyear PV non- interest spending . \n\u2022 The timing of policy changes to make fiscal policy sustainable has important implications for the w ell-\nbeing of future generations as is shown in Table 2.  \n \no Table 2 shows that, if reform begins in 2033 or 2043, the estimated magnitude of primary surplus \nincreases necessary to close the 75 -year fiscal gap is 5.7 percent  and 7.0 percent of GDP, resp ectiv ely. \nThe difference between the primary surplus increase necessary if reform begins in 2033 or 2043 and the increase necessary if reform begins in 2023, an additional 0.9 and 2.1 percentage points, \nrespectively, is a measure of the additional burden p olicy  delay would impose on future generations.   \no The longer pol icy action to close the fiscal gap  is delayed, the larger the post -reform primary surpluses \nmust be to achieve the target debt -to-GDP ratio at the end of the 75- year period. Future generations  are \nharmed by a policy delay because the higher the primary sur pluses are during their lifetimes, the \ngreater is the difference between the taxes they pay and the programmatic spending from which they benefit.  \nConclusion  \n\u2022 Projections in the Financial Report  indicate that the government \u2019s debt -to-GDP ratio is projected to rise \nover the 75- year projection period and beyond if current policy is kept in place.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2055, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ae82b099-b960-490e-85ba-5c572555fece": {"__data__": {"id_": "ae82b099-b960-490e-85ba-5c572555fece", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "executive_summary_2022.pdf", "file_path": "reports/executive_summary_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1042072, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2023-02-16"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ab9ea28-9d95-4026-9142-5fbcd75c2e0e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "executive_summary_2022.pdf", "file_path": "reports/executive_summary_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1042072, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2023-02-16"}, "hash": "f2ea2d6f755e34bfc4d65f033cce628d77c0ffbd0efd3d18d11714a828bef485", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4fe2abe4-40ad-4c71-85cd-253e5db04c23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "executive_summary_2022.pdf", "file_path": "reports/executive_summary_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1042072, "creation_date": "2024-07-21", "last_modified_date": "2023-02-16"}, "hash": "55b63abeeef75fc2b435cd3a3a557031767bb1a2c5982c091c561b6027fd3a27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "o The longer pol icy action to close the fiscal gap  is delayed, the larger the post -reform primary surpluses \nmust be to achieve the target debt -to-GDP ratio at the end of the 75- year period.
