In the case of `rouge-1`, Summary 2 outperforms Summary 1, indicating a better overlap of individual words and for `rouge-l`, Summary 2 has a higher score, implying a closer match in the longest common subsequences, and thus a potentially better overall summarization in capturing the main content and order of the original text.

They also correlate worse with human scores. Given the advancements in LLMs, which are adept at producing fluent and coherent summaries, traditional metrics like `ROUGE` may inadvertently penalize these models.

Unlike metrics like `ROUGE` or `BERTScore` that rely on comparison to reference summaries, the `gpt-4` based evaluator assesses the quality of generated content based solely on the input prompt and text, without any ground truth references. This makes it applicable to new datasets and tasks where human references are sparse or unavailable. \n",

    "    4. **Fluency**: Rates the grammar and readability of the summary.\n",

    "In this demonstration, we're using a direct scoring function where `gpt-4` generates a discrete score (1-5) for each metric. Normalizing the scores and taking a weighted sum could result in more robust, continuous scores that better reflect the quality and diversity of the summaries."

    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that LLM-based metrics could have a bias towards preferring LLM-generated texts over human-written texts. Additionally LLM based metrics are sensitive to system messages/prompts. We recommend experimenting with other techniques that can help improve performance and/or get consistent scores, striking the right balance between high-quality expensive evaluation and automated evaluations. It is also worth noting that this scoring methodology is currently limited by `gpt-4`'s context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating abstractive summarization remains an open area for further improvement. Traditional metrics like `ROUGE`, `BLEU`, and `BERTScore` provide useful automatic evaluation but have limitations in capturing semantic similarity and nuanced aspects of summarization quality. Moreover, they require reference outputs which can be expensive to collect/label. LLM-based metrics offer promise as a reference-free method of evaluating coherence, fluency, and relevance. However, they too have potential biases favoring text generated by LLMs. Ultimately, a combination of automatic metrics and human evaluation is ideal for reliably assessing abstractive summarization systems. While human evaluation is indispensable for gaining a comprehensive understanding of summary quality, it should be complemented with automated evaluation to enable efficient, large-scale testing. The field will continue to evolve more robust evaluation techniques, balancing quality, scalability, and fairness. Advancing evaluation methods is crucial for driving progress in production applications.\n",
